## Incomplete requirements

1. Coudn't make the on hover work, if you click on the country it displays the sentiment but not when you hover over, with more time I could have make it work.
2. Display the countries based on the sentiment selected. With more time I could have done it.
3. Summary of sentiments on hover. 


### Everything else required is implemented.
 On country selection, if this includes several regions in the data, it will zoom in and a different interactive map will appear with the corresponding regions of that country. (Some countries cannot be displayed as the library didn't have the data: Japan...)

 With more time I would have liked to: 
 * Implement tests
 * Implement the docker functionality
 * Clean up the code, make rendering more dynamic.
 * Allow to upload a set of data


 ### Thank you for consider me for this position and I hope my application is successful. Have a nice rest of your day.
